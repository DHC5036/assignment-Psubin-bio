Q1. What happens if you implement only parts of a GRU, e.g., with only a reset gate or only an update gate?
  If reset, you will have long-term dependencies, and if update, short-term dependencies short-term.
 
Q2. Compare the computational cost for GRUs, LSTMs, and regular RNNs for a given hidden dimension. Pay special attention to the training and inference cost.
  LSTM > GRU > RNN
